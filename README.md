This project is a Clothing Donation Tracker designed to simplify tracking donated clothing items. It manages five categories: shirts, pants, jackets, skirts, and shoes. The system allows users to input items they wish to donate and automatically updates the respective category count. If an invalid item is entered, the application provides clear feedback. The program also generates a detailed summary of all donations, displaying totals for each category and a grand total. Featuring an intuitive console-based interface, the tracker ensures efficient management of clothing donations while promoting transparency and gratitude for contributors.
